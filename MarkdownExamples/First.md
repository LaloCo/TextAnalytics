2. First numbered element
3. how will this show ?

    1. sublist
    2.      1. And we can sublist even further
    3.      2. nice going ?
    5. 2nd sublist item
    6.      3. list 

# Header 1 (needs a space after pound sign
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

######## no header 

unordered lists are done with +, - or *
+ list
+ list 
+ list 

- another list
- another list
- another list

* going to list 3
* another item in list 3
* well done

Checkbox list??? How do you do that. You start with unordered list (-,+,star) and then space and square brackets open / close
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

bold is done by either __ or ** surrounding
For example __bold text comes here__
and italic is one underscore or star, for example
_italic_ how do you like that :)
Notice that there can be no space between the ending pair of underscores or stars.
You can mix up by chaning _ and *
__hello bold phrase** Now I have stars in bold ** and end__
whereas __bold stars here *italic starts here* italic is done now and bold ends here__

Crazy :)

Tables starts here
Handy for showing two images of different size and still control how they show up
columns are separated by the pipe symbol
You need at least 3 dashes below the headers


Android | iOS | 3rd col
------- | ------- | -------
Medium App for Android | Medium Apps for iOS
whatever happens | with the columns is nice | 3rd col
how | does | this | look ?         Well look is not shown cause we only have 3 headers I guess

seems like 3 cols is max
algin with colon
to left is left alinged
both left and right is centered
and right is right

example

Left aligned | mid aligned | right aligned
:-- | :-: | --:
left | mid | right no spaces
continue on left | still mid | and right again

Now something __special__
How to link.
Well what you want to show is in square brackets and what you link to in 
parantheses
so...

Great that works as well :)



**Images**
----------

Make sure though that the link is pointing to a jpg or other image file
Let us try in a table

col1 | col2 | col3
--- | --- | ---

+ The above 2nd line is format info for the columns (see form in edit mode)
+ Below you find a table with what to type to obtain a specfic alginment
+ Note, the formatting string is the 2nd row (not shown)
+ You need header row, format row, other rows.
+ You cannot change format in between rows
+ To work around that, start new tables...
